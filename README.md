Applied database research

## What is it?
At the moment, this is simply applied research for possible future pursuits in developing a highly versatile cross-platform database.


## How to run
The repo comes with the built Node.js (_test.js_) file, you should be able to run the file and create collections wherever the file is located.

It exposes a very simple API allowing one to access/manipulate collections. For more details see the Collection class in src/haxedb/storage/Collection.
